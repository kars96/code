Text::Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) Tutorial, URL->https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/
 Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. This tutorial will give you a great understanding on Data Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level applications and need of algorithms, and data structures. This tutorial is designed for Computer Science graduates as well as Software Professionals who are willing to learn data structures and algorithm programming in simple and easy steps. After completing this tutorial you will be at intermediate level of expertise from where you can take yourself to higher level of expertise. Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of C programming language, text editor, and execution of programs, etc. For most of the examples given in this tutorial you will find Try it option, so just make use of this option to execute your programs on the spot and enjoy your learning. Try the following example using the Try it option available at the top right corner of the following sample code box − © Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.
