Causes of elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood can be caused by infections, viral hepatitis, anemia, genetic diseases, and liver problems. Symptoms of elevated bilirubin levels depend on the cause; however, jaundice is a common sign. Treatment for elevated bilirubin levels depend on the cause. Complete Blood Count A complete blood count (CBC) is a calculation of the cellular makeup of blood. A CBC measures: the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets in the blood, and aids in diagnosing conditions and disease such as malignancy, anemia, or blood clotting problems. the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets in the blood, and aids in diagnosing conditions and disease such as malignancy, anemia, or blood clotting problems. malignancy, anemia, or blood clotting problems. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Overview Congestive heart failure (CHF) refers to a condition in which the heart loses the ability to function properly. Heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathies are just a few potential causes of congestive heart failure. Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure may include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, angina, and edema. Physical examination, patient history, blood tests, and imaging tests are used to diagnose congestive heart failure. Treatment of heart failure consists of lifestyle modification and taking medications to decrease fluid in the body and ease the strain on the heart. The prognosis of a patient with congestive heart failure depends on the stage of the heart failure and the overall condition of the individual. Ferritin Blood Test Ferritin is a protein in the body that is used to store iron. The ferritin blood test can detect elevated or low levels of ferritin in the body, which may indicate disease such as hemochromatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers, anemia, or iron deficiency. Gallbladder Pain (Gall Bladder Pain) Gallbladder pain (often misspelled "gall bladder") is generally produced by of five problems, biliary colic, cholecystitis, gallstones, and pancreatitis. Causes of gallbladder pain include intermitent blockage of ducts by gallstones or gallstone inflammation and/or sludge that also may involve irritation or infection of surrounding tissues, or when a bile duct is completely blocked.

Hepatitis A, B, and C spread in different ways, causing mild to serious effects on the liver. Learn about hepatitis symptoms and available vaccines to prevent hepatitis infection. Liver Blood Tests An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the presence of certain liver enzymes in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream, and can lead to diseases like fatty liver, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hepatitis. Several medications also can increase liver enzyme test results. Liver Disease Quiz What is liver disease? Take the Liver Disease Quiz and test your knowledge about this organ and its function. MRI Scan MRI (or magnetic resonance imaging) scan is a radiology technique which uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures. MRI scanning is painless and does not involve X-ray radiation. Patients with heart pacemakers, metal implants, or metal chips or clips in or around the eyes cannot be scanned with MRI because of the effect of the magnet. Polycythemia (High Red Blood Cell Count) Polycythemia (elevated red blood cell count) causes are either primary (aquired or genetic mutations) or secondary (diseases, conditions, high altitude). Treatment of polycythemia depends on the cause. Triglyceride Test Triglycerides are a common form of fat that we digest. Triglycerides are the main ingredient in animal fats and vegetable oils. Elevated levels of triglycerides are a risk factor for heart disease, heart attack, stroke, fatty liver disease, and pancreatitis. Elevated levels of triglycerides are also associated with diseases like diabetes, kidney disease, and medications (for example, diuretics, birth control pills, and beta blockers). Dietary changes, and medication if necessary can help lower triglyceride blood levels.

It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. There are many kinds of liver diseases. Viruses cause some of them, like hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Others can be the result of drugs, poisons or drinking too much alcohol. If the liver forms scar tissue because of an illness, it's called cirrhosis. Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, can be one sign of liver disease. Cancer can affect the liver. You could also inherit a liver disease such as hemochromatosis. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.

 Micrograph of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Gastroenterology 000205   Liver disease (also called hepatic disease) is a type of damage to or disease of the liver.  1 Associated medical conditions 1.1 Types 1.1 Types 2 Mechanism 3 Diagnosis 4 Treatment 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading There are more than a hundred different kinds of liver disease,symptoms may include jaundice and weight loss. These are some of the most common:  Fascioliasis, a parasitic infection of liver caused by a Liver fluke of the Fasciola genus, mostly the Fasciola hepatica.  Hepatitis, inflammation of the liver, is caused by various viruses (viral hepatitis) also by some liver toxins (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis), autoimmunity (autoimmune hepatitis) or hereditary conditions.  Alcoholic liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Analogous terms such as "drug-induced" or "toxic" liver disease are also used to refer to disorders caused by various drugs.  Fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis) is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells.  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a spectrum of disease associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Hereditary diseases that cause damage to the liver include hemochromatosis,  involving accumulation of iron in the body, and Wilson's disease. Liver damage is also a clinical feature of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency   and glycogen storage disease type II.  In transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis, the liver produces a mutated transthyretin protein which has severe neurodegenerative and/or cardiopathic effects. Liver transplantation can give a curative treatment option.  Gilbert's syndrome, a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism found in a small percent of the population, can cause mild jaundice.  Cirrhosis is the formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) in the place of liver cells that have died due to a variety of causes, including viral hepatitis, alcohol overconsumption, and other forms of liver toxicity. Cirrhosis causes chronic liver failure.  Primary liver cancer most commonly manifests as hepatocellular carcinoma and/or cholangiocarcinoma; rarer forms include angiosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma of the liver. (Many liver malignancies are secondary lesions that have metastasized from primary cancers in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, such as the kidneys, lungs.)  Primary biliary cirrhosis is a serious autoimmune disease of the bile capillaries.  Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a serious chronic inflammatory disease of the bile duct, which is believed to be autoimmune in origin.  Budd–Chiari syndrome is the clinical picture caused by occlusion of the hepatic vein.  Liver disease can occur through several mechanisms. A common form of liver disease is viral infection. Viral hepatitides such as Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus can be vertically transmitted during birth via contact with infected blood.   According to a 2012 NICE publication, "about 85% of hepatitis B infections in newborns become chronic".  In occult cases, Hepatitis B virus is present by HBV DNA, but testing for HBsAg is negative.  High consumption of alcohol can lead to several forms of liver disease including alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.  In the earlier stages of alcoholic liver disease, fat builds up in the liver's cells due to increased creation of triglycerides and fatty acids and a decreased ability to break down fatty acids.  Progression of the disease can lead to liver inflammation from the excess fat in the liver. Scarring in the liver often occurs as the body attempts to heal and extensive scarring can lead to the development of cirrhosis in more advanced stages of the disease.  Approximately 3-10% of individuals with cirrhosis develop a form of liver cancer known as hepatocellular carcinoma.  According to Tilg, et al, gut microbiome could very well have an effect, be involved in the pathophysiology, on the various types of liver disease which an individual may encounter.  A number of liver function tests (LFTs) are available to test the proper function of the liver. These test for the presence of enzymes in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue, metabolites or products. serum proteins, serum albumin, serum globulin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time.  Anti-viral medications are available to treat infections such as hepatitis B.  Other conditions may be managed by slowing down disease progression, for example: By using steroid-based drugs in autoimmune hepatitis.  Regularly removing a quantity of blood from a vein (venesection) in the iron overload condition, hemochromatosis.  Wilson’s disease, a condition where copper builds up in the body, can be managed with drugs which bind copper allowing it to be passed from your body in urine.  In cholestatic liver disease, (where the flow of bile is affected due to cystic fibrosis ) a medication called ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO, also referred to as UDCA) may be given.

 Who We Are Liver Disease Liver Health Research & Education Newsroom WAYS TO GIVE CLF in your area Home Home Diagnosing Liver Disease Liver Disease and You Liver Diseases and Complications Liver Disease in Canada Report Liver Transplants Although liver disease is stereotypically linked to alcohol or drugs, the truth is that there are over 100 known forms of liver disease caused by a variety of factors and affecting everyone from infants to older adults. For information on specific forms of liver disease, click on 'Types of Liver Disease' in the menu on the left.  Cirrhosis is often considered to be a form of liver disease and may be the only liver-related condition that many people have heard of. In fact, cirrhosis is a condition that results from permanent damage or scarring of the liver. It is the end stage of many different forms of liver disease and is known to cause a number of other health problems, including variceal bleeding, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Many types of liver disease still have unknown causes but the most frequent liver diseases are generally caused by one of the following factors: Viral hepatitis Caused by viruses that attack the liver, viral hepatitis comes in many forms. The most common forms world-wide are hepatitis A, B and C. Although hepatitis A and B can be prevented by vaccine, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C. In Canada, hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver transplants. Obesity The leading cause of liver disease in Canada is fatty liver disease linked to obesity. Alcohol Factors such as gender, age, nationality, weight and health can affect how a person’s liver metabolizes alcohol. When the liver has too much alcohol to handle, normal liver function may be interrupted leading to a chemical imbalance. If the liver is required to detoxify alcohol continuously, liver cells may be destroyed or altered resulting in fat deposits (fatty liver) and more seriously, either inflammation (alcoholic hepatitis) and/or permanent scarring (cirrhosis). Liver cancer can also result from alcohol induced liver disease.             10 drinks a week for women with no more than 2 drinks a day and                  15 drinks a week for men, with no more than 3 drinks a day.                      Click here to read CLF's Position Statement on Alcohol     Genetics Several forms of liver disease are caused or thought to be caused, by defective genes. These forms of liver disease may be diagnosed in infancy or may not show up until later in life. Examples include hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, tyrosinemia, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and Glycogen Storage disease. Autoimmune disorders Sometimes a body’s immune system may begin to attack the liver or bile ducts causing inflammation and scarring which leads to a progressive form of liver disease. Examples of liver diseases believed to be caused by the immune system are primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis. Drugs and toxins The liver is responsible for processing most of the chemicals and medications that enter your body – this leaves it vulnerable to acute or chronic liver disease caused by chemicals. In some cases, this is a predictable consequence of overexposure or over-consumption of certain chemicals such as acetaminophen or industrial toxins like polyvinyl chloride or carbon tetrachloride. In other cases, chemicals can cause an unpredictable reaction. Cancer Although primary liver cancer is relatively uncommon, many other forms of cancer often metastasize in the liver. Because the liver filters a high volume of blood which may be carrying cancer cells, it is susceptible to developing a form of secondary cancer. If cancer originates in the liver, it is often caused by hepatitis B, hepatitis C or it can develop in cases of advanced liver disease when cirrhosis is present.       Liver Health Liver Facts Liver Disease Myths How The Liver Works Liver Disease Prevention Liver Disease Treatment Types of Liver Disease Liver Transplants Liver Health Research Liver Disease Research Liver Disease Support Groups Healthy Liver Guidelines Living With Viral Hepatitis Diagnosing Liver Disease Questions About Liver Disease

The liver is the second largest organ in the body. It works hard, performing hundreds of complex functions, including: fighting infections and illness removing toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, from the body controlling cholesterol levels helping blood to clot (thicken) releasing bile, a liquid that breaks down fats and aids digestion Liver disease doesn't usually cause any obvious signs or symptoms until it's fairly advanced and the liver is damaged. At this stage, possible symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss and jaundice. Listed below are some specific types of liver disease. The links provide more detailed information about each type. Alcohol-related liver disease – where the liver is damaged after years of alcohol misuse, this can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – a build-up of fat within liver cells, usually seen in overweight people or those who are obese Hepatitis – which is inflammation (swelling) of the liver caused by a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances such as alcohol  Haemochromatosis – an inherited disorder where there's a gradual build-up of iron in the body, usually around the liver Primary biliary cirrhosis – a rare, long-term type of liver disease that damages the bile ducts in the liver It’s important to note that all types of liver disease can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), not just alcohol-related liver disease. In the UK, liver disease is on the increase. Three of the main causes of liver disease are: obesity  undiagnosed hepatitis infection alcohol misuse  These causes of liver disease are all preventable so it's important to make sure: you're a healthy weight for your height; you can use the BMI healthy weight calculator  you avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol; read more about alcohol units take the appropriate measures to prevent getting hepatitis, such as getting vaccinated if you're at risk Alcoholic liver disease is a range of conditions and associated symptoms that develop when the liver becomes damaged due to alcohol misuse. In this video, consultant hepatologist Mark Wright talks about how avoiding alcohol can help those with the condition.

Liver problems The liver is an organ about the size of a football that sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances. Liver disease can be inherited (genetic) or caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses and alcohol use. Obesity is also associated with liver damage. Over time, damage to the liver results in scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. Symptoms Share Tweet Curry MP, et al.

What Are the Symptoms of Liver Failure? How Is Liver Failure Treated? How Can Liver Failure Be Prevented? Liver failure occurs when large parts of the liver become damaged beyond repair and the liver is no longer able to function. Liver failure is a life-threatening condition that demands urgent medical care. Most often, liver failure occurs gradually and over many years. However, a more rare condition known as acute liver failure occurs rapidly (in as little as 48 hours) and can be difficult to detect initially. The most common causes of chronic liver failure (where the liver fails over months to years) include: Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Long-term alcohol consumption Cirrhosis Hemochromatosis (an inherited disorder that causes the body to absorb and store too much iron) Malnutrition The causes of acute liver failure, when the liver fails rapidly, however, are often different. These include: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose Viruses including hepatitis A, B, and C (especially in children) Reactions to certain prescription and herbal medications Ingestion of poisonous wild mushrooms   The initial symptoms of liver failure are often ones that can be due to any number or conditions. Because of this, liver failure may be initially difficult to diagnose. Early symptoms include: Nausea Loss of appetite Fatigue Diarrhea However, as liver failure progresses, the symptoms become more serious, requiring urgent care. These symptoms include: Jaundice Bleeding easily Swollen abdomen Mental disorientation or confusion (known as hepatic encephalopathy) Sleepiness Coma If detected early enough, acute liver failure caused by an overdose of acetaminophen can sometimes be treated and its effects reversed. Likewise, if a virus causes liver failure, supportive care can be given at a hospital to treat the symptoms until the virus runs its course. In these cases, the liver will sometimes recover on its own. For liver failure that is the result of long-term deterioration, the initial treatment goal may be to save whatever part of the liver is still functioning. If this is not possible, then a liver transplant is required. Fortunately, liver transplant is a common procedure that is often successful. The best way to prevent liver failure is to limit your risk of developing cirrhosis or hepatitis. Here are some tips to help prevent these conditions: Get a hepatitis vaccine or an immunoglobulin shot to prevent hepatitis A or B. Eat a proper diet from all of the food groups. Drink alcohol in moderation. Avoid alcohol when you are taking acetaminophen (Tylenol). Practice proper hygiene. Since germs are commonly spread by hands, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after you use the bathroom. Also, wash your hands before you touch any food. Don't handle any blood or blood products. Don't share any personal toiletry items, including toothbrushes and razors. If you get a tattoo or a body piercing, make sure the conditions are sanitary and all equipment is aseptic (free of disease-causing microorganisms). Be sure to use protection (condoms) when having sex. If you use illegal intravenous drugs, don't share needles with anyone.   SOURCE: American Liver Foundation.   Pagination What to Do When Ulcerative Colitis Flares Common Constipation Treatments How to Treat a Crohn's Flare Newly Diagnosed With Crohn's?

How Is Hemochromatosis Diagnosed and Treated? Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency What Are the Symptoms of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency? How Is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Diagnosed and Treated? What Is the Prognosis for People With Inherited Liver Diseases? The two most common inherited liver diseases are hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Hemochromatosis is a disease in which deposits of iron collect in the liver and other organs. The primary form of this disease is one of the most common inherited diseases in the U.S. -- up to one in every 200 people has the disease, many unknowingly. When one family member has this disorder, siblings, parents, and children are also at risk. A secondary form of hemochromatosis is not genetic and is caused by other diseases, such as thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder that causes anemia. The iron overload associated with hemochromatosis affects men more often than it does women. Because women lose blood through menstruation, women are unlikely to show signs of iron overload until after menopause. Hemochromatosis is more common in people of Western European descent. The symptoms of hemochromatosis may include: Liver disease Joint pain Fatigue Unexplained weight loss A darkening of the skin frequently referred to as "bronzing" Abdominal pain Loss of sexual desire People with hemochromatosis may also have signs of diabetes and heart disease and may also develop liver cancer, cirrhosis, testicular atrophy (wasting away), and infertility. Whenever hemochromatosis is suspected, a blood test to look for excess iron in the blood is performed. If excess iron is found, a genetic blood test (hemochromatosis DNA test) may be ordered. The genetic test is also used to screen family members of patients with a positive genetic test. The goal of treatment is to remove excess iron from the body, as well as reduce any symptoms or complications that have resulted from the disease. Excess iron is removed from the body in a procedure called phlebotomy. During the procedure, one-half liter of blood is removed from the body each week for a period of up to two or three years until the iron buildup has been reduced. After this initial treatment, phlebotomies are needed less frequently. The frequency varies based on individual circumstances. Another treatment for hemochromatosis is iron chelation therapy. Iron chelation uses medicine to remove excess iron from your body, and it is a good option for people who can't have routine blood removal. The medicine used in iron chelation therapy is either injected or taken orally (by mouth). Injected iron chelation therapy is done at a doctor's office. Oral iron chelation therapy can be done at home.   To help keep iron levels down, people with hemochromatosis should avoid iron, most commonly found in vitamin preparations. If you have hemochromatosis, your health care provider or a dietitian can put together a diet that is right for you. Most people with hemochromatosis should avoid alcohol. If hemochromatosis has caused cirrhosis, the risk of liver cancer becomes higher. As a result, screening for cancer should be performed on a regular basis. In this inherited liver disease an important liver protein known as alpha-1 antitrypsin is either lacking or exists in lower than normal levels in the blood. People with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are able to produce this protein; however, the disease prevents it from entering the bloodstream and it instead accumulates in the liver. Alpha-1 antitrypsin protein protects the lungs from damage due to naturally occurring enzymes. When the protein is too low or non-existent, the lungs can become damaged, leading to difficulty breathing and, in many people with the condition, emphysema. People with this disease are also at risk of developing cirrhosis. The first symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency will usually be symptoms of its effects on the lungs, including shortness of breath or wheezing. Unexplained weight loss and a barrel-shaped chest, which is commonly associated with the presence of emphysema, can also be signs of the condition. As the disease progresses, symptoms typical of emphysema or cirrhosis include: Fatigue Chronic cough Swelling of the ankles and feet Jaundice (this is more commonly associated with cirrhosis) Fluid in the abdomen (ascites) Physical signs, such as a barrel-shaped chest and respiratory problems, may lead your doctor to suspect alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. A blood test that tests specifically for the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein will help confirm the diagnosis. There is no established treatment to cure alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency but it can be treated by replacing the protein in the bloodstream. However, experts are not clear on how effective this technique is and who should receive it. Other approaches to treating alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency involve treating the complications of emphysema and cirrhosis. This includes antibiotics to combat respiratory infections, inhaled medication to make breathing easier, and diuretics and other medication to reduce any fluid buildup in the abdomen. Personal behavior, such as avoiding alcohol, quitting smoking, and eating a healthy diet, can also help keep symptoms and complications from becoming severe. Your health care provider or dietitian can recommend a diet that is right for you. Because the disease affects the lungs, people with the condition are more prone to respiratory infections. Therefore, both flu and pneumonia vaccinations are recommended to help prevent these infections. If you feel you are developing a cold or cough, contact your health care provider immediately so treatment can begin as soon as possible. Occasionally, the lungs or liver deteriorate despite treatment. In such cases, a liver transplant may be needed. With proper treatment, hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency disease are usually not fatal. However, complications associated with the diseases can be. It is very important that people with inherited liver diseases do all they can to stay healthy. SOURCES: WebMD Medical Reference. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
