Rabi Sankar Patro & Ors.", "headnote": "EDUCATIONClarification of Judgement dated 3.11.2017 in the case of Orissa Lift Irrigation Corp. Ltd. sought - As per said decision Degrees in Engineering awarded by some deemed to be Universities through distance education mode were found to be invalid - In respect of students enrolled during the academic years 2001 to 2005, the degree and consequent benefits were to remain suspended, till their abilities were tested through an examination held by AICTE - Consequently advertisement issued by AICTE requiring diploma holders and those who had secured Master's degrees in Engineering to appear in the test - Whether such advertisement was valid. Held, it is clear from the judgement dt. 3.11.2017 that the controversy related to validity of degrees in Engineering, irrespective of post graduate or graduate degrees. However courses leading to diploma being not the subject matter of the judgement, were wrongly included in the advertisement.HELDIt is true, as is evident from paragraphs 34 and 46 of the judgment that the controversy in the present case pertained to validity of degrees in Engineering conferred by the Deemed to be Universities through distance education mode and this Court was not called upon to consider validity of diplomas conferred by such Deemed to be Universities. However the advertisement issued by AICTE covers diploma courses as well. We therefore accept the submissions advanced by Mr. Dhruv Mehta and Mr. M.L. Verma, learned Senior Advocates and clarify that validity of such courses leading to diplomas was not the subject matter of the judgment. (Para 3)At the same time, courses leading to award of degrees, whether graduate or post graduate degrees, was certainly the matter in issue. We therefore reject the submission of Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Advocate and do not find any infirmity in the understanding of and the advertisement issued by AICTE. (Para 4)Vide judgement dated 3.11.2017 Court held that Deemed Universities which had no expertise in the field of Engineering and on which status of Deemed Universities was conferred not because of their excellence in the field of Engineering, had no right to award degrees in Engineering through Distance Education mode - Contention that VMRF a deemed university, stood on a better footing, as its field of activity and excellence also included subjects in Engineering - Another contention that in case of AAI Deemed University, though degrees were granted by such deemed university, instructions were\u00a0 imparted by ITM International which was an institute of repute. Held, contentions cannot be accepted. Concept of conferring degrees in Engineering through distance education mode itself was never approved in principle by AICTE and Study Centres were never inspected or approved. ITM International was itself not authorized to award degrees in Engineering nor was it affiliated to any State or Central University. AAI, which was granting degrees, had no expertise or excellence in the field of Engineering.HELDMr. Anupam Lal Das, learned Advocate is right that JRN, AAI and IASE had no expertise in the field or subjects of Engineering and the status of Deemed Universities conferred on them was not because of their excellence in the field of Engineering. As against these three Deemed to be Universities, the case of VMRF stood on a better footing as its field of activity and excellence also included subjects in Engineering. However that was not the only basis of the judgment. The facts still remain that conferral of degrees in Engineering through distance education mode was never approved in principle by AICTE and the Study Centres were never inspected or approved. We therefore reject the submission of Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned Advocate. (Para 5)If award of degrees in Engineering through distance education mode by Deemed to be Universities, as a concept or principle was not accepted by AICTE, it is immaterial whether the Study Centre in question was ITM International. Said Institution was not by itself authorized to award degrees in Engineering on its own nor was it affiliated to any State or Central University at the relevant time. The courses conducted by said institution led to award of degrees of AAI, which had no expertise or excellence in the field of Engineering and through distance education mode. We therefore reject the submission advanced by Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate. (Para 6)Modification of judgement dt. 3.11.2017 - Vide said judgement, degrees awarded in Engineering through distance education mode by Deemed Universities and consequent advantage, were suspended in respect of students enrolled for academic year 2001 to 2005, till they cleared test held by AICTE \u2013 Contention that controversy in the judgment related to in-service candidates who were diploma holders and obtained degree in Engineering while in service \u2013 Whether an exception should be made in favour of candidates whose qualifications were independently considered by an authority and were selected through competitive selection process, by dispensing with the requirement of passing the test. Held, no exception can be made as infirmity in their degrees is basic and fundamental. But submission that, unlike in-service candidates, they may loose their job if suspension of their degrees and all advantages were to apply as indicated in the judgment, is accepted. Even on passing the test, restoration of their original position would be difficult. Therefore, as a one-time relaxation, they can retain the degrees and all the advantages flowing therefrom till one month after the declaration of the result of such test or till 31.07.2018 whichever is earlier. If they clear the test in first attempt they would be entitled to retain all advantages. But if they fail or do not appear for the test, the directions in the judgment shall apply. They will be entitled to second attempt in terms of the judgment but this exception shall not apply for such second attempt. Directions issued.HELDWe now turn to the general submission advanced by all the learned counsel that the candidates after securing the degrees in Engineering through distance education mode, have advanced in career and that their ability was tested at various levels and as such requirement of passing the examination in terms of the judgment be dispensed with in their case. We cannot make any such exception. The infirmity in their degrees is basic and fundamental and cannot be wished away. At the same time, we find some force in their submission that if the suspension of their degrees and all advantages were to apply as indicated in the judgment, the concerned candidates may lose their jobs and even if they were to successfully pass the test, restoration of their jobs and present position would pose some difficulty. (Para 7)We, therefore, as a one-time relaxation in favour of those candidates who were enrolled during the academic years 2001-2005 and who, in terms of the judgment, are eligible to appear at the test to be conducted by AICTE, direct:", "url": "http://judgementstoday.com/judgements/MYerp3wbOB/orissa-lift-irrigation-corp-ltd-v-rabi-sankar-patro-ors", "appeal_number": "M.A. Nos. 1795-1796 of 2017 In Civil Appeal Nos. 17869-17870 of 2017 With Diary No(s). 39667/2017, IA 138802/2017 in C.A.

Various directions were issued in the judgment and more particularly in paragraph No.53 of the judgment. The gist of the applications and the contentions advanced by the learned counsel were as follows:A] M.A. Nos. 1795-1796 of 2017 in Civil Appeal Nos.17869-17870 of 2017 (I.A.

The applicants, holding diplomas in Engineering, enrolled themselves in 2005 in courses leading to award of B.Tech degree offered by Deemed to be University in question through distance learning mode. Later, on the basis of the degrees awarded by the Deemed to be Universities, they underwent independent selection undertaken by Union Public Service Commission and entered certain services as direct recruits and have presently either been engaged in the same service or have advanced in career on the basis of such selection by UPSC.1.1. Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Advocate submitted that the controversy in the judgment was principally concerning the cases of in-service candidates who were initially employed as diploma holders but while in service had been awarded degrees in Engineering by Deemed to be Universities in question through distance learning mode; and that this Court was not called upon to consider cases where such degrees themselves became the foundation for a subsequent employment or selection and further advancement in career. He further submitted that an exception be made in favour of such candidates whose qualifications were independently considered by an authority such as UPSC and were selected through competitive selection process and in any case, even if the Judgment were to apply to such candidates, the suspension of their degrees and all advantages flowing therefrom till they pass the test as indicated in the judgment ought not to be insisted upon. He submitted that unlike in-service candidates who may not be losing their jobs, such candidates, who had independently undergone fresh selection and were directly appointed would lose their jobs completely and even if they were to successfully pass the test conducted by AICTE, restoration of their original position and jobs would itself become a difficult proposition.B] M.A. Nos.13-14/2018 in C.A.

Later they acquired degrees in M.Tech and other qualifications based on such B.Tech degree and have thereafter advanced in career.1.3. Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate while adopting the submissions of Mr. V.

The applicant, IASE, Deemed to be University seeks clarification that the judgment applied only to courses leading to degrees in Engineering awarded by Deemed to be Universities through distance education mode and that diploma courses are not covered by the judgment.1.17. Mr. M.L. Verma, learned Senior Advocate invited our attention to the advertisement issued by AICTE. His submissions on the issue in question are on lines similar to the submissions advanced by Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate.2. We also heard Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of AICTE.3. It is true, as is evident from paragraphs 34 and 46 of the judgment that the controversy in the present case pertained to validity of degrees in Engineering conferred by the Deemed to be Universities through distance education mode and this Court was not called upon to consider validity of diplomas conferred by such Deemed to be Universities. However the advertisement issued by AICTE covers diploma courses as well. We therefore accept the submissions advanced by Mr. Dhruv Mehta and Mr. M.L. Verma, learned Senior Advocates and clarify that validity of such courses leading to diplomas was not the subject matter of the judgment.4. At the same time, courses leading to award of degrees, whether graduate or post graduate degrees, was certainly the matter in issue. We therefore reject the submission of Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Advocate and do not find any infirmity in the understanding of and the advertisement issued by AICTE.5. Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned Advocate is right that JRN, AAI and IASE had no expertise in the field or subjects of Engineering and the status of Deemed Universities conferred on them was not because of their excellence in the field of Engineering. As against these three Deemed to be Universities, the case of VMRF stood on a better footing as its field of activity and excellence also included subjects in Engineering. However that was not the only basis of the judgment. The facts still remain that conferral of degrees in Engineering through distance education mode was never approved in principle by AICTE and the Study Centres were never inspected or approved. We therefore reject the submission of Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned Advocate.6. If award of degrees in Engineering through distance education mode by Deemed to be Universities, as a concept or principle was not accepted by AICTE, it is immaterial whether the Study Centre in question was ITM International. Said Institution was not by itself authorized to award degrees in Engineering on its own nor was it affiliated to any State or Central University at the relevant time. The courses conducted by said institution led to award of degrees of AAI, which had no expertise or excellence in the field of Engineering and through distance education mode. We therefore reject the submission advanced by Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate.7. We now turn to the general submission advanced by all the learned counsel that the candidates after securing the degrees in Engineering through distance education mode, have advanced in career and that their ability was tested at various levels and as such requirement of passing the examination in terms of the judgment be dispensed with in their case. We cannot make any such exception. The infirmity in their degrees is basic and fundamental and cannot be wished away. At the same time, we find some force in their submission that if the suspension of their degrees and all advantages were to apply as indicated in the judgment, the concerned candidates may lose their jobs and even if they were to successfully pass the test, restoration of their jobs and present position would pose some difficulty.7.1. We, therefore, as a one-time relaxation in favour of those candidates who were enrolled during the academic years 2001-2005 and who, in terms of the judgment, are eligible to appear at the test to be conducted by AICTE, direct:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a] All such candidates, who wish to appear at the forthcoming test to be conducted by AICTE in May-June 2018 and who exercise option to appear at the test in terms of the judgment, can retain the degrees in question and all the advantages flowing therefrom till one month after the declaration of the result of such test or till 31.07.2018 whichever is earlier.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b] This facility is given as one-time exception so that those who have the ability and can pass the test in the first attempt itself, should not be put to inconvenience. If the candidates pass in such first attempt, they would be entitled to retain all the advantages. But if they fail or choose not to appear, the directions in the judgment shall apply, in that the degrees and all advantages shall stand suspended and withdrawn. At the cost of repetition, it is made clear that no more such chances or exceptions will be given or made. They will undoubtedly be entitled to appear on the second occasion in terms of the judgment but this exception shall not apply for such second attempt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c] We direct AICTE to conduct the test in May-June 2018 and declare the result well in time, in terms of our directions in the judgment and this Order. AICTE shall however extend the time to exercise the option to appear at the test suitably.8. Except for the directions given in the preceding paragraph i.e. paragraph 7 and the clarification as regards courses leading to award of diplomas as mentioned hereinabove, we reject all the other submissions.9. All applications, petitions and writ petitions stand disposed of in aforesaid terms. No costs.**********"}
