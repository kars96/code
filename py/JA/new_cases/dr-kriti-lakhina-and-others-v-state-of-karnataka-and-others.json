Medical Colleges and against Govt. quota seats in non-Governmental institutions. Held,\u00a0 matter is no longer res integra. Information Bulletin (PGET-2014) issued by State of Karnataka in the year 2014, which contained similar eligibility criteria as provided in Clause 4.1 of the present Information Bulletin (PGET-2018), was held to be violative of the principle of equality in Vishal Goyal\u2019s case as it gave preference based on domicile. Present case is fully covered by said case. Therefore Clause 4.1 of the Information Bulletin (PGET-2018) is held to be invalid to the extent it disqualifies petitioners and similarly situated candidates from competing for admission to Post-Graduate Medical/Dental Courses in Govt. Medical Colleges and against Govt. quota seats in non-governmental institutions.HELDParagraphs 13 and 15 of the Judgment of this Court in Vishal Goyal(supra) are clear that the Information Bulletin for PGET-2014 did not actually give institutional preference to students who had passed MBBS/BDS from Colleges or universities in State of Karnataka but made some of them ineligible to take the entrance test for admission to Post- Graduate Medical or Dental Course in State of Karnataka and that said clause was held ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution and declared null and void. The relevant clause under consideration, namely, Clause 4.1 of the Information Bulletin for PGET-2018 is identical in substance to the one that was considered in Vishal Goyal (supra). The matter is thus no longer res integra and is completely covered by the decision in Vishal Goyal(supra). In the circumstances, we respectfully follow the decision of this Court in Vishal Goyal (supra) and hold Clause 4.1 of the Information Bulletin (PGET-2018) which was published on the website on 10.03.2018 to be invalid to the extent it disqualifies petitioners and similarly situated candidates who completed their MBBS/BDS Degree Courses from colleges situated in Karnataka from competing for admission to Post-Graduate Medical/Dental Courses in Government Medical Colleges and against government quota seats in non-governmental institutions.
