E-Tender – Bids were to be submitted latest by 1300 hrs of 27.7.2017 – Ist respondent uploaded its bid at about 12:16 hours on 27.7.2017 on appellant’s website but despite pressing ‘freeze button’, received no acknowledgement of submission - NIC which had designed and maintained the e-portal, ruled out technical glitch as 427 bids were successfully submitted at the relevant time - It held bid to be invalid as respondent failed to click press button – Yet High Court directed NIC to access files and transfer the same to respondent no.2 MHADA for decrypting and considering the bid documents as valid – Justification. Held, in view of NIC’s affidavit that the data uploaded by Ist respondent could not be retrieved even jointly with MHADA, with prevailing Government of India Guidelines, repeated statements of Ist respondent that the bid documents was retrievable, cannot be accepted. If at the relevant time Respondent faced any technical glitch, it should have contacted NIC in the remaining 44 minutes. Ist respondent was familiar with the process as it had participated earlier also. Directions issued by High Court conferred a second opportunity on Ist Respondent, which was impermissible.
